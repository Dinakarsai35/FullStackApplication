Create a api in API gateway in Amazon and select rest api and click on Build, So Api is created and create resources with path and resource name once after api is created. Then create method for your resource. In this case i am having status, student and students resources. So, for status i am creating get method as this resource is used to retrieve status. For student, i am creating get, post, patch and delete ,methods as we can get, insert, update or delete the records of the student. For students resource I will create only get method as we have to retrieve all the students information. Once all resources and methods are created.
Then Deploy the api. So we can get the link of that api.
